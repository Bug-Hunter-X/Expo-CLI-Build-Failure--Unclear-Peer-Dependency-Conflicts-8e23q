// expoBugSolution.js
// This file demonstrates a potential solution to the peer dependency conflict.
// The key is to carefully examine package.json and resolve conflicts
// using techniques such as updating packages, using yarn resolutions, etc.

// Example of updating a package that might be causing a conflict
// npm update react-native-maps
// Or using yarn resolutions (refer to yarn documentation for details): 
// "resolutions": {
//   "react-native-maps": "^0.30.0" 
// }

// Further details on resolving package conflicts are available in the readme.
