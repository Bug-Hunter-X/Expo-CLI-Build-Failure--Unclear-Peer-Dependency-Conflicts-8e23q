While building an Expo app, I encountered an error related to the Expo CLI's handling of certain package dependencies.  Specifically, when I tried to install a package with peer dependencies that conflicted with other packages in my project, Expo CLI failed to resolve the conflicts properly, resulting in a build failure. The error messages were not very clear and didn't directly point to the root cause, making it difficult to debug.  The code itself didn't show any obvious errors.  The issue only arose during the build process initiated by `expo build:ios` or `expo build:android`.
